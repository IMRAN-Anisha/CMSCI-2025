----------------------------------------------------------Overview----------------------------------------------------
This project is a maze puzzle game that utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
and the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm
for procedural maze generation and pathfinding. The game is built using Python and Pygame,
and it emphasizes structured game design principles.

---------------------------------------------------------Features-----------------------------------------------------

1. Procedural Maze Generation: The DFS algorithm is used to generate unique mazes dynamically.

2. Player Navigation: Players can move through the maze using arrow keys.

3. AI-Driven Hint System: The game provides hints based on DFS traversal.

4. Adaptive Difficulty: The AI system adjusts the puzzle complexity based on player performance.

------------------------------------------------------Object-Oriented Design------------------------------------------

The game follows OOP principles to maintain modularity and scalability:

Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Composition

------------------------------------------Depth-First Search (DFS) in Maze Generation---------------------------------

DFS is a powerful algorithm for creating and solving mazes:

Maze Generation: DFS generates mazes by exploring paths deeply before backtracking, ensuring a solvable structure.

Solution Pathfinding: DFS can traverse the maze to find a solution from the start to the goal.

-------------------------------------------------------AI Adaptive System---------------------------------------------

The AI system adjusts difficulty and provides hints based on DFS pathfinding.

Key Features:

1. Provide Hints: Analyzes the solution path and suggests the next step.

2. Adjust Difficulty: Monitors player performance and modifies maze complexity accordingly.

---------------------------------------------------Error Handling Strategy--------------------------------------------

To ensure the best playing experince the following factors are considered:

Invalid Moves: Prevents the player from moving through walls or out of bounds.

File I/O Errors: Ensures smooth loading and saving of game states.

Unsolvable Mazes: Implements safeguards to regenerate the maze if an issue is detected.

------------------------------------------------------Testing Strategy------------------------------------------------
To counteract those particular situations, the following has been done to ensure the best user experience:

Unit Testing: Verifies individual methods, such as player movement and maze generation.

Integration Testing: Ensures components (e.g., AI, DFS, Player) work together properly.

System Testing: Simulates real user behavior to validate game flow and error handling.

---------------------------------------------------Ethical Considerations---------------------------------------------

Fair Gameplay: The AI ensures puzzles remain challenging but solvable.

Data Privacy: No unnecessary user data is collected.

Use of Assets: The game only uses public domain or self-created assets.

--------------------------------------------------Future Enhancements-------------------------------------------------

1. More Puzzle Variations: Implement additional puzzle types using the OOP structure.

2. Multiplayer Mode: Introduce cooperative maze-solving challenges.

3. Enhanced AI: Improve the hint system with machine learning techniques.
